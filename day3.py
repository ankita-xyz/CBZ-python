# 🌟 Decision Making (if, elif, else) 🤔

# if: Executes a block of code if the condition is True.
# elif: Executes a block of code if the previous if condition is False and the elif condition is True. You can have multiple elif blocks.
# else: Executes a block of code if none of the previous if or elif conditions are True.


#🌟 While Loop 💀⚡💀⚡

# Repeats a block of code as long as a given condition is True.
# The condition is checked before each iteration.

#🌟 For Loop 😵‍💫😵‍💫

# Iterates over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, string, or range).
# Executes the code block for each item in the sequence.


#🌟 Continue Statement

# Skips the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.

#🌟Pass Statement

# Acts as a placeholder. It does nothing, but it's necessary to maintain the proper structure of the code.

#🌟Break Statement

# Exits the loop immediately, regardless of whether the loop condition is still True.
